Quiz board is a form that contains questions about Javascript.It allows a student answer questions from a multiple choice questions that I have created.
## Behavior Driven Development
* A user has freedom to choose an answer to a question;
* A user can only choose one answer in every question;
* If one clicks on another option the pointer moves to that other chosen option and unmarks the one marked previously;

I used HTML, css/styles,js/scripts,js/bootstrap, terminal and atom.
